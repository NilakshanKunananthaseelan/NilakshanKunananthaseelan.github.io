        <h1>Research Statement</h1>

        <p>
          I believe that artificial intelligence, much like electricity, will fundamentally change the way we live, work, and solve problems. Just as electricity simplified countless tasks and empowered humanity to innovate in unimaginable ways, AI will augment human capabilities and simplify jobs across industries. It will become an essential utility, quietly powering the fabric of our daily lives and revolutionizing the way we think about labor, creativity, and intelligence. However, for AI to truly fulfill this potential, it must evolve beyond task-specific models and begin to embody more human-like cognitive intelligence, capable of adapting to new environments and learning from diverse signals.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the core of my research is the belief that <strong>learning from multimodal signals — combining visual, textual, auditory, and other sensory data — opens new horizons for AI models</strong>. These models can begin to mimic the way humans perceive, reason, and make decisions. Humans don't learn in isolation. We constantly absorb information from our surroundings, integrating different types of input to make sense of the world. For AI to reach similar cognitive capabilities, it must move beyond single-modality learning and start embedding knowledge from multiple modalities. This multimodal learning holds the key to enabling AI systems to perform complex reasoning tasks and interact with the world in a more human-like way.
        </p>
        <h2>Intelligence Emerges from Interaction and Observation</h2>

        <p>
          I strongly believe that <strong>intelligence emerges from observing, interacting, and continually learning from other intelligent systems</strong>. From birth, humans and animals alike learn through observation and interaction. A baby observes how people around them speak and behave, gradually picking up language, emotions, and social norms. This process of <strong>active interaction with the environment is what shapes intelligence</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most artificial intelligence systems today are trained on static data, without the ability to interact with the world or other agents. While this has led to impressive achievements, such as large language models (LLMs) that mimic human language, these systems remain incomplete. <strong>True intelligence requires ongoing interaction and adaptation.</strong> When an agent starts interacting with its environment, it introduces new learning constraints that are not present in static datasets.
        </p>

        <h2>The Role of Multimodal Learning</h2>

        <p>
          Most AI systems are trained on narrow, task-specific datasets. However, <strong>human intelligence is not limited to a single modality</strong>. We process and combine information from multiple sources — sights, sounds, language, touch — to form a cohesive understanding of the world. For AI to reach human-like intelligence, it must do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Multimodal learning opens a new frontier in AI.</strong> By integrating multiple sensory inputs, we can build models that are more robust, generalizable, and capable of complex reasoning. My research focuses on developing methods to improve the performance of <strong>multimodal large language models (MLLMs)</strong> and enabling them to adapt to new environments. I am particularly interested in how these models can be personalized for specific tasks through <strong>parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)</strong> and <strong>continual learning techniques</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Failures Fuel Research Success</h2>

        <p>
          Research is a journey of continuous exploration, often riddled with failures. However, I believe that <strong>strong research stems from failure</strong>. Each failure is a learning opportunity that brings us closer to solving a complex problem. In fact, if a research project never faces failure, it's likely not pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. <em>Fail fast, learn fast</em> — that’s how innovation happens.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve also realized that <strong>if you can't explain the issue you're facing in your research, you likely don't understand the research question</strong>. Clarity of thought and communication is essential in research. The process of articulating a problem helps refine our understanding of it. This is why I make it a point to write down the problems I encounter, analyze them from different angles, and simplify them until they are easy to communicate. Only then can meaningful solutions emerge.
        </p>

        <h2>Focusing on the Right Research Questions</h2>

        <p>
          One of the greatest challenges in research is the tendency to branch out into countless directions. <strong>Research questions can branch into millions of sub-questions</strong>, each leading down its own rabbit hole. However, I firmly believe that <strong>success in research comes from focusing on your core question and doing the job well</strong>. It’s important to resist the temptation to chase every interesting tangent and instead stay committed to your branch. Once progress has been made, you can always explore the neighboring branches later. This disciplined approach ensures depth of knowledge before breadth.
        </p>

        

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          In conclusion, my research aims to contribute to the vision of creating scalable, efficient AI models that can learn from diverse modalities, adapt to new environments, and continuously evolve through interaction. I firmly believe that <strong>if you can't write your research statement yourself, you don’t understand your research and your own goals</strong>. Research is a deeply personal journey — one that involves failures, learning, and discovery. I am committed to advancing the field of AI and exploring new horizons in human-AI interaction to create a future where intelligent systems truly augment human potential.
